Included apps in PIMPIM:

* TOC
{:toc}

## Dashboard
Collection of metrics from the other apps

## Tasks
Task management.
Mainly built with the GTD productivity methodology in mind.

The data model also supports other task management strategies, like the the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent-Important) with priorities 1-4 representing the four importance levels. Kanban should work too, though by using another app.

## Notes
A cleaner, single-purpose interface to notes.
Uses the same document model as `Tasks`.

## Messages
General purpose messaging central.
Email is best kept in files, it is said. While that is said. Does it replicate? Does it work offline? Oh.. Right. Anyway, this may come in handy anyway (for machines sending info to a common place or something).

Untagged messages, either when <code>tag:[]</code> or when tag field missing from document, will be show in 'Inbox'.

## Logbook
Work in progress

## Finances
Work in progress

## Inventory
Work in progress

## Make your own
Pimpim's data model is flat and not relational, which enables other apps to use the same data if replicated to another database, I.E. CouchDB. 
Create a standalone app or a piece of analytics software to analyze productivity habits, semantics, interessting discoveries about yourself, or `<insert lofty idea here>`.
